ANGULAR
1.ANGULAR is famous abouts its Single Page Application(SPA).
2.We make use of DOM Manipulations in ANGULAR..
3.We use TypeScript inside ANGULAR
4.Angular Js is only for Desktop based Applications but Angular2 is compatible for all devices...
5.Angular2: faster,having server,databinding,AngularCLI,having many environments...
6SPA-Single Page Application...is web application or web site that interacts with the user by dynamically
rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new page from a  server...
7.Node should be above 8 then only it will be compatible with angular2.
8.......Creating Project structure:
			[we should have node & npm before we install angular]
			a.sudo npm -g @angular/cli(installing angularCLI)
			***we get cli along with packages with typescript***
			b.ng -v (to check version)
			c.ng (to run)
			d.ng new ProjectName
			***Package.js is register to maintain all dependencies***
			e.ProjectName: ng serve(runs application into development environment)
			f.4200 default port for Angular.
			g.ng serve --open/ng serve -o(opening app in brower happens automatically)
			h.ng serve -o --port portnumber
			i.ProjectStructure:
				-->e2e-end to end testing
				-->angular.json(main file)
				-->package-lack.json(all dependencies)
				-->src(source  src folder. All Angular components, templates, 
				          styles, images, and anything else your app needs go here.)----->app(main component)
										**asserts-->where we can store images,anything on wholesale we want to add
										                   ex:bootstrap files....
										**favicon-->top icon
										**index.html-->home page
										**Karma.con.js-->test file (ng test)
										**main.ts-->main thread
										**style.css-->default css file throught project
									    **Polyfill.ts-->Different browsers have different levels of support of the 
										                     web standards. Polyfills help normalize those differences.
9.Angular --Uses typescript(MicroSoft)--Object Oriented Programming Language
10.Browser cannot understand TypeScript.But ts has 1.Objects
																			     2.Inheretance
																				 3.Polymorphism
																				 4.Oops.
																				 ***ts is superset of javascript**
11.We code in ts & then bundle our code downgrading to JavaScript code as browser cannot understand
     typrscript.
12.For compiling ts to js we requires type script compiler.Process of compilition from ts to js is
    called "Transpilation".
13.js is basically loosely typed and ts is strictly typed (type validation)
14***Installing TypeScript****
				sudo npm -g install typescript
				tsc --version(TypeScriptCompilation)
				converting .ts to .js-->tsc filename.ts
				running--->	node filename.js
