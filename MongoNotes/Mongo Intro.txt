MONGO

1.nosql 
2.open-source document database.
3.MongoDB provides high performance data persistence.
  -->Supports for embedded data models reduces I/O activity on db system.
  -->Indexes(internal) supports faster query 
  -->can include keys from embedded documents and arrays..
4.MongDB provides rich query language
  -->to supports CURD(read and write operations) operations
  -->Data Aggregations
  -->text search and geospatial
5.MongoDB provides High Avaliability
  -->Mongodb's replication facility, replica set, provides:
     --->automatic failover and 
	 --->data redundancy
	 ****A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, 
	     providing redundancy and increasing data availability.
6.MongoDB provides horizontal scalability as part of its core functionality:
    Sharding distributes data across a cluster of machines.
7.Supports Multiple storage engines.
8.Mongodb uses JavaScript
9.No RDB,No RDBMS and  No SQL so Only ....JavaScript
10.RelationShip concept makes database very slow so there is no such concept of 
   relations in no-sql.
11.Mongodb is designed to store any type(cache data and engine related data) of data 
   where as sql designed to store application related data.
12.In SQL everything we store in terms of Tables, In no-sql we store everything in the form
   of Collections or Documents(Json/Bson)
13.In SQL it comes with default Authentication and Authorization. 
   In no-sql it is an open db
14.In SQL Structure is of table type with default Schema
   In no-sql it is purly dynamic shema db (changes w.r.t to data)
15.In SQL well schema(static)
   In no-sql schema(dynamic)--->Json Operated.
16.Example of SQL: Oracle Server,MySql,post query, H2D query, Mariya db
   Example of No-SQL:Mongodb,Dynamodb(Based on cloud--AWS),Kasandra,Redis
