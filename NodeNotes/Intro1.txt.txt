1.JavaScript is browser based(no system resources)....
unlike c and c++ they are platform based(On the top of O.S means they
utilize system resources).

2.JavaScript:
   ---->Asynchronous code
   ---->Call Back
   ---->Event Driven
   ---->Prototype 
   these things makes J.S famouse inorder to makes these things avaliable
   on system level we use NODE.
   
3.Node is J.S run time environment.Inside node there will be J.S engine with certain native libraries
   and core modules....
	  NODE gives:
      a.Access to system resources
	  b.Event Driven
	  c.Asynchronous 
	  d.Allows to execute J.S (BackEnd JavaScript)
 
4.Rending engines :
		chrome>v8(open source JavaScript Engine)
		I.E>Chakra
		Morzilla>SpiderMonkey
		
5. Install and Download:
	--->Nodejs(WebSite)

6.node -v (version of node J.s)

7.nodejs comes with  node and npm(node package manager)--->Single Package

8.npm -v (checking version of npm)

9.hit node --->Node shell will be opened (Execute J.S here)

10.Node Shell is REPL terminal.Read Evaluate Print Loop.Why to REPL--->Debugging. Ctrl+C(twice)
to come out of REPL

11.Node Js is SINGLE threaded...*

12.Node J.s Global Objects(hit global inside REPL to see object)
		global --------------> in brower it is (window)
		console------------->in browers it is(console)
		process------------->in browser it is(document)
		
13.To Execute J.S file inside Node:
		node filename.js
		
14.process.openStdin( );

15.Converting buffer content to string:
	toString( );
