ABSTRACT:
1.Abstraction is an Object Oriented programming concept
2.A class can specify how an inherited class should implement the class itself, 
  including any abstract methods specified.
3.The concept behind abstraction is that--hiding the complexity of the implementation 
  from inherited classes and and then allowing them to implement the functionality 
  themselves.
  *****An abstract class looks and feels like a standard class with a key exception: 
  ABSTRACT CLASSES MAY NEVER BE INSTANTIATED.
4.In TypeScript abstraction can be achieved by using the abstract keyword -
  which can be applied to both classes and methods specified in classes.

  
5.We cannot create instance of abstract class
6.In order to implement our abstract class we need to create a subclass and extend it
  using the extends keyword.
7.And we need to implement parent class abstract methods or else it will throw an error 
  saying that--"NON-ABSTRACT CLASS 'xyz(child class)' DOSENOT INHERITED ABSTRACT MEMBERS 'ABSTRACT MEMBER'
  FROM CLASS 'abc(parent class)'.
