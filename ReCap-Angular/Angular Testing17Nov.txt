Test(Automated)
1.unit test(testing done with out help of external resources)
2.Intergrating test(having some external resources--functionality integrated
                    with internal and external)
					example: component based on services and template
***both unit and intergation test are written by developer...
***for unit and intergation we have frameworks---Jasmine and Karma
***Jasmine is an angular test framework that allows us to use bunch of matchers(functions to create test cases)
   assertion library which have matcher functionality 
   ***this matcher are similar to node assertion library functions
   ***Jasmine is mainly focused of BDD(behavioural driven development) based test
3.end to end (using frameworks--->angular--protractor)

***MOCHA : 
			1.test runner
			2."describe(group of test cases)" and "it(individual test cases)"....
			***IN ANGULAR:
			3."it" block is called as spec test.
			4."describe" is called as suit
		
1.ng new my-app-test(application to test)
**karma.conf.js --- it runs when we hit ng test
2.ng test (hit -- to run your test cases) this opens an browser!
3.comment 3rd spec(it) last line inorde to remove certain errors
