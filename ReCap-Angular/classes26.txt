CLASS:
1.TypeScript is object oriented JavaScript.
2.TypeScript supports object-oriented programming features like classes,
  interfaces, etc.
3.A class in terms of OOP is a blueprint for creating objects.
4.A class encapsulates data for the object.
5.Typescript gives built in support for this concept called class.
6.Typescript gets this feature from ES6.

SYNTAX:
class Class_Name{
//class scope
}
**used to create instances out of class these instances are objects
			 
			 class consists of data members-fields,functions,constructor
                                1.data memebers.
								2.memeber functions.
								3.constructor.( Responsible for allocating memory for the 
								                objects of the class)
												
			1.A constructor is a special function of the class that is responsible for initializing
      		  the variables of the class. TypeScript defines a constructor using the constructor keyword.
			  A constructor is a function and hence can be parameterized.
			2.The this keyword refers to the current instance of the class. 
			3.To create an instance of the class, use the new keyword followed by the class name.
								
			****If we want to access data memebers or memebers function out
				side class we should create object inside class we use "this."
			
			****constructor are only one for one class
				In java we are having multiple constructor
								
			****we need to initilize all properties once they are declared inside
				constructor but inside java we are having multiple constructors concept
				so inorder to over come this we use "OPTIONAL" --- "?"
								
								name?:string;
								but optional parameters are to kept at last in sequence
								
								SYNTAX:Constructor
								class className{
								
								data members1
								data members2
								data members3
											.

											.
							    member functions1

								member functions3

											.
								constructor(argument1,argument2,argument3){
								this.argument1=argument1
								this.argument2=argument2
								this.argument3=argument3
								} //declaring a constructor
								}
		****memory creation using new (object)
		    let objname = new classname(argument1,argument2,argument3);
			objename.methodName();
								
		****using zero value arguments we can dynamically initilize object
			then we should not initilize the values at class level using 
			constructor.
								
		****new keyword related to memory management
		
		ACCESSING ATTRIBUTES AND FUNCTIONS:
		1.A class’s attributes and functions can be accessed through the object.
		2.Use the ‘ . ’ dot notation (called as the period) to access the data members of a class.
		
		//accessing an attribute 
		obj.field_name 

		//accessing a function 
		obj.function_name()
