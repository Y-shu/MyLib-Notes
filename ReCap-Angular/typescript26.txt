Difference Between TypeScript and JavaScript:

TypeScript:
1.OOPs based
2.Strictly typed
3.Allow type restriction 
4.Compiler to compile our code.

JavaScript:
1.OBP (Object Based Programming language) doesn't support Polymorphism and Inheritence
2.Loosely typed
3.Dynamic Typing
4.Interpreted Language

1.TypeScript code get compiled and generate JavaScript code.this compilation is called 
  as "Transpilation".
  we use tsc(TypeScriptCompiler) Compilers.
2.MicroSoft Owns this language. Typescript is superset of JavaScript.

****Installation of TypeScript:

	npm install -g typescript 
	
****Compilation:
    1.tsc filename.ts --->converts ts to js
	2.node filename.js --->can run inside brower.
****Exta Added types inside typescript:
    tuple: nothing but array allows us to restrict type inside and size
	       
		   let arrayName : [string,number]=[string value,number value]
		   
	enum:group of constant elements,we cannot change it!
	
	       enum name {
					Key=Value,
					Key=Value,
					Key=Value,
					}
					1.If we dont mention any key by default it takes 0.
					2.If we mention and number to starting key it gets automatically increments
					3.Once a value is declared their values.
					4.Once a value is declared inside enum it cannot be changed its constant
					  throught the program.
