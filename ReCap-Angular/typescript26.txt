Why TYPE SCRIPT?
1.TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript 
2.Using TypeScript can help avoid painful bugs by type checking the code
3.TypeScript can actually report issues without you even saving your file, 
  and leverage the type system to help you write code even faster.
JavaScript fails to embrace the features of Object Orientation, strong type checking
and compile-time error checks prevents JavaScript from succeeding at the enterprise 
level as a full-fledged server-side technology.TypeScript was presented to bridge this gap.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TYPESCRIPT AND JAVASCRIPT:
******Code will get reduced mainly!!!!
typescript:
class Person {
}
javascript:
var Person = (function () {
   function Person() {
   }
   return Person;
}());

TypeScript:
1.OOPs based
2.Strictly typed
3.Allow type restriction 
4.Compiler to compile our code.

JavaScript:
1.OBP (Object Based Programming language) doesn't support Polymorphism and Inheritence
2.Loosely typed
3.Dynamic Typing
4.Interpreted Language

****The core difference is that statically-typed languages perform type checking at
compile time,while dynamically-typed languages perform type checking at run time.

****TypeScript is both a language and a set of tools.

1.TypeScript code get compiled and generate JavaScript code.this compilation is called 
  as "Transpilation".
  we use tsc(TypeScriptCompiler) Compilers.
2.MicroSoft Owns this language. Typescript is superset of JavaScript.

****Installation of TypeScript:

	npm install -g typescript 
	
****Compilation:
    1.tsc filename.ts --->converts ts to js
	2.node filename.js --->can run inside brower.
****Exta Added types inside typescript:
    tuple: nothing but array allows us to restrict type inside and size
	       
		   let arrayName : [string,number]=[string value,number value]
		   
	enum:group of constant elements,we cannot change it!
	
	       enum name {
					Key=Value,
					Key=Value,
					Key=Value,
					}
					1.If we dont mention any key by default it takes 0.
					2.If we mention and number to starting key it gets automatically increments
					3.Once a value is declared their values.
					4.Once a value is declared inside enum it cannot be changed its constant
					  throught the program.
